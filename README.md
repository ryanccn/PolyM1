# PolyM1

PolyM1 is an **M1 hack** for [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/). It also works with similar launchers like [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) and [HMCL](https://hmcl.huangyuhui.net/) that support wrapper commands.

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanccn/PolyM1/main/install.sh | sh
```

It will download the native libraries for M1. Follow the instructions to configure the wrapper command, and have fun!

You can rerun the command above any time to update `polym1` or the native libraries. A better installation / download process is planned.
